3/3 points

Good start! You've highlighted some important points, but your explanation could be more detailed. For SPAs, you could expand on how they improve user experience with faster navigation since only the necessary content is reloaded, and how they reduce server load by making fewer full-page requests. For MPAs, clarify that they are often better for SEO and can handle more complex, large-scale applications where different pages may need distinct layouts and content. Adding these points will provide a more complete comparison.
