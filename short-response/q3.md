When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer
It is appropriate to use the `*` path for a `Route` in react router when you watch to match any sub-routes that arent defined.

Good effort! You nailed that the `*` path is used for matching undefined routes. A way that you could have elevated your answer is to specify that this is typically used to display a '404 Not Found' page when no other routes match. 
Fun fact: in React Router v6, the `*` path only matches when no other more specific paths are matched, making it useful for catch-all routes.
